This is Srijan Saha's submission for LeaqueX Assignment developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can check the hosted application at [leaguex-assignment.vercel.app/](https://leaguex-assignment.vercel.app/)

## Feature Implement

- News fetching using [News API](https://newsapi.org/)
- Sorting and filtering options
- User friendly routing
- Offline access using Service Worker API - to checkout offline use and caching try searching something and the switch of your network connection
- Responsive UI
- Optimized performance measured using lighthouse [Lighthousereport](./public/assets/lighthouse-leaguex.png)
- Optimized metadata for SEO

Please note that news fetching might not work on the deployed link since I don't have a paid plan for the API.
